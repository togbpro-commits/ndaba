# Appearance prop

Customizing the appearance of Clerk components is a powerful way to make your application look and feel unique. Clerk provides a way to customize the appearance of its components using the `appearance` prop.

The `appearance` prop can be used to share styles across every component, or applied individually to any of the Clerk components. When using it for global styling, the prop is available wherever you initialize the Clerk integration. For most SDKs, this means applying it to the [<ClerkProvider>](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/clerk-provider.md) component, while in others, it's configured through the SDK's Clerk integration or plugin.

This applies to all of the React-based packages, like [Next.js](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/getting-started/quickstart.md), as well as [the pure JavaScript ClerkJS package](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/overview.md).

## Properties

The `appearance` prop accepts the following properties:

| Name          | Type                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
